I.	INTRODUCTION 
      The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has given rise to many groundbreaking technologies, one of the most contentious being deepfake technology. Deepfakes, or highly realistic manipulations of visual and audio material, have become popular in recent times because of their potential for misinformation and social manipulation. The word "deepfake" originated from the couple of deep learning algorithms, mainly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and the word "fake." Deepfake technology has facilitated people to produce fake videos, photos, and audio files that cannot be distinguished from authentic content. The doctored media are usually applied for nefarious purposes, like circulating false information, conducting political propaganda, or even cyberbullying and slander. As deepfake technology continues to advance and become more accessible, the detection of such manipulated media has become an urgent concern in numerous industries, ranging from news to social media, entertainment, and law enforcement. Deepfake detection tools generally used either Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to process static images and dynamic video content. CNNs are good at extracting spatial features from images but can be challenged by videos, where the temporal dimension also needs to be taken into account. RNNs and its more complex variant, LSTM, can scan sequences of video frames to identify very subtle discrepancies that may not be apparent in an individual frame. Existing deepfake detection systems are good for many applications, but they often have issues with real-time detection, scalability, and computational cost. This work suggests a new hybrid solution which combines the capabilities of MobileNet and LSTM networks to overcome these limitations... While many existing deepfake detection systems are effective, they tend to face challenges when it comes to real-time detection, scalability, and computational efficiency. This project suggests a new hybrid approach that incorporates the strengths of MobileNet and LSTM networks to overcome the above limitations. The major goal of this project is to create a real-time efficient and scalable deepfake detection system that together incorporates spatial feature extraction from MobileNet and temporal pattern recognition from LSTM networks. This model will be able to distinguish between static images and dynamic video content, a complete solution towards detecting deepfakes. Given its emphasis on real-time detection, this model seeks to lend its hand in meeting the burgeoning demand for equipment that can serve to counteract the proliferation of false media in several fields such as social networking sites, media houses, and digital forensics. The system to be proposed will support processing high amounts of media content in real-time and offer immediate feedback to the users regarding the authenticity of the media they consume.

III.	METHODOLOGY
      The Hybrid MobileNet-LSTM Model proposed is a formalized approach to obtaining accurate as shown in Fig. 1, timely deepfake detection with improved scalability and interpretability. The proposed system will identify spatial and temporal anomalies in deepfake media, superior to the performance of conventional detecting mechanisms. The approach is structured into several phases, such as data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, use of a deep learning model, and deployment.

Fig. 1. System Architecture
A.	DATA COLLECTION AND PREPROCESSING
      To build a trustworthy deepfake detection model, there should be a vast corpus of real and deepfake media. The model is trained on widely used deepfake datasets such as FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DFDC to address diverse and high-quality training samples. The data, after being collected, is processed by a preprocessing pipeline that extracts informative features and removes noise. Faces are cropped from video using OpenCV, and face detection models like dlib's frontal face detector crop and align the face landmarks. Faces are resized, normalized, and augmented to solve the model generalization problems. Color normalization and pixel intensity scaling during preprocessing normalize the input data to train the model effectively.

B.	FEATURE EXTRACTION USING MOBILENET
      After data preprocessing, the system acquires spatial features through MobileNet, a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with high efficiency in feature extraction. MobileNet processes every frame to detect pixel-level anomalies like unnatural lighting, texture inconsistency, and blending flaws, typical in deepfakes. In contrast to conventional CNNs, MobileNet minimizes computational complexity by a significant margin, and thus the system is more efficient and faster. The spatial features acquired are now passed on to the LSTM model for further temporal analysis.

C.	TEMPORAL ANALYSIS USING LSTM
      Though CNN-based models focus on single-frame analysis, they cannot detect motion-based inconsistencies in videos. To counter this weakness, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are utilized to examine sequences of frames and detect anomalies in motion dynamics. LSTM effectively detects unnatural facial motion, head motion, and lip-sync errors, which are prevalent in deepfake videos but difficult to detect in static images. Through examination of temporal dependencies, the LSTM-based model significantly enhances video-based deepfake detection accuracy. The combination of spatial analysis by MobileNet and temporal detection by LSTM makes the proposed system stronger compared to existing solutions.

D.	MODEL TRAINING AND OPTIMIZATION
      MobileNet-LSTM hybrid is trained with a supervised learning approach where deepfake and real media are appropriately tagged. The model is trained thoroughly with batch normalization, dropout layers, and hyperparameter adjustment for generalization. Adam optimizer is used for convergence acceleration, and cross-entropy loss function is employed for enabling real vs. deepfake precise classification. The system is trained on GPU-based machines for effective handling of big datasets.

E.	DEPLOYMENT AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
      Once trained, the deepfake model is hosted on Streamlit, an interactive web application that provides users a UI to upload images and videos to be processed. The model is optimized for real-time processing to enable immediate classification results without causing any latency. For scalability, the system is containerized with Docker, which is simple to deploy on cloud infrastructure, edge devices, and mobile applications. The light weight of the MobileNet-LSTM hybrid model makes it efficient to run on low-power devices and hence available for social media monitoring, forensic analysis, and disinformation detection.

F.	PROPOSED SYSTEM
      To address the limitations of current deepfake detection methods, this research presents a Hybrid MobileNet-LSTM Model that balances spatial and temporal analysis for greater efficiency and real-time performance. The system proposed here combines MobileNet for spatial feature extraction efficiency and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for temporal pattern recognition, rendering it a leading candidate for the detection of manipulated media in images and videos. In contrast to conventional CNN-based models, which employ pixel-level inconsistency, the proposed system analyzes differences frame by frame to identify motion artifacts and unnatural transitions in deepfake videos. This makes the detection more robust, especially against high quality deepfake manipulation that is hard to identify using conventional image based methods.
      The framework is able to perform real-time deepfake detection through a straightforward Streamlit-based web interface and offers users an upload media facility and real-time classification results. To enable an additional interpretability, Explainable AI (XAI) methods like Grad-CAM heatmaps are utilized, offering visual explanations of the identified anomalies. This enables AI decision-making transparency and robustifies the system for forensic analysis, content moderation, and security use cases.

G.	COMPARISON OF EXISTING AND PROPOSED SYSTEM
      In the existing system, deepfake detection employs CNNs and RNNs, which examine spatial and temporal features separately. CNNs detect pixel inconsistency and RNNs detect motion artifacts in a video. These are not practical for high-quality deepfakes, are computationally costly, and do not have real-time explainability, and therefore are not feasible for large-scale deployment. In the new system, we employ MobileNet for spatial verification and LSTM for detecting temporal patterns, which improves accuracy and detection efficiency. MobileNet offers fast feature extraction, and LSTM detects inconsistency between frames, which allows real-time detection of deepfakes. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like Grad-CAM heatmaps also offer visual explanations, which improves transparency. The system is energy-efficient, scalable, and can accommodate new deepfake approaches, and therefore is superior to the existing technique.

A Frame Analysis Over Time plot offers such change, showing stable predictions, oscillations when the system is uncertain, and outliers and needs for re-evaluation. High confidence (> 90%) says accurate classification and low confidence (< 50%) suggests uncertainty. This frame-by-frame method raises accuracy, identifies manipulated content, and provides strength through the limitation of misclassification based on false frames.

Fig. 5. Frame Analysis Over Time


Interpretation of the Graph
      The graph in illustrates the decision-making process of the model over time:
â€¢	Confidence levels greater than 90% exhibit high confidence for classification.
â€¢	Lower confidence scores (< 50%) indicate uncertainty regarding frame classification.
â€¢	A decrease or increase in confidence will demonstrate the change in between various classes of content.
â€¢	Enhances Accuracy: The system makes a more accurate last decision by making use of many frames, unlike analyzing a solitary frame.
â€¢	Captures Manipulation: Should some frames record inconsistencies, these may signify manipulations of adjustments within the content.
â€¢	Guarantees Robustness: The method lessens misclassifications to zero by one single deceptive frame.
      The system effectively distinguishes between real and fake content, providing weighted probabilities for both categories. The accuracy of the system remains high, ensuring reliable results for detecting fraudulent content.
      The system continuously evaluates frames and plots confidence levels to detect inconsistencies. The graphical representation helps understand how the model identifies fake or real content across multiple frames.
